SVM
- support vector machines
  - maximzes distance between seperating line and nearest point for each cluster
    - this distance is called the margin
  - maximizing the margin makes the system more robust against noise in the data
    - i=f line is too close, noise could make a point jump the line
    - want to maximize robustness
